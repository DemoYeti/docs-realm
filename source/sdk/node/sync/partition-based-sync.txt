Atlas Device Sync has two sync modes:  :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>`
and the older Partition-Based Sync. We recommend using Flexible Sync.
The information on this page is for users who would still like to
use Parition-Based Sync to build their Node.js app. For information
about Partition-Based Sync, refer to :ref:`partition-based-sync`
