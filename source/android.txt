=========================
MongoDB Realm Android SDK
=========================

The {+service+} Android SDK allows client applications on the Android
platform to access data stored in local {+realms+} and interact with
{+backend+} services like Functions, MongoDB Data Access, and
authentication.

To learn how to add the {+service+} Android SDK library as a dependency
to your Android application, see :ref:`Install Realm for Android
<install-android>`.

To learn about the different kinds of data you can store in {+realms+},
see :ref:`Realms <android-realms>`, :ref:`Objects <android-realm-objects>`, and
:ref:`Relationships <android-client-relationships>`.

To learn how to read and write local {+realm+} data, see
:ref:`Reads <android-realm-database-reads>` and :ref:`Writes
<android-realm-database-writes>`.

To learn how to safely interact with {+client-database+} across threads in an
application, see :ref:`Threading <android-client-threading>`.

To learn how to query for data in local {+realms+}, see
:ref:`Query Engine <android-client-query-engine>`.

To learn how to work with {+realm+} query results, see
:ref:`Collections <android-client-collections>`, :ref:`Notifications
<android-client-notifications>`.

To learn how to connect to a {+backend+} {+app-short+} to call
Functions, query data in an instance of {+atlas+}, and synchronize data
in {+realms+}, see :doc:`Call a Function </functions/call-a-function>`.

To learn how to handle schema updates in your client application, see
:ref:`Migrations <android-client-migrations>`.
